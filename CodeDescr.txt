###### RegFun.Py

This Script is a script with several functions that can be accessed when a user
is going through multivariate regression analysis to determine a targt variable, trainning the model,
and testing the model. The libraries imported in were sklearn, numpy, and matplotlib to generate
histograms, scatterplots, and linear regression values to evaluate training models and testing models.
Cross Validation and Gradient Descent were method for analysis of multivariat regression analysis.
This script will handle more than one variable as independent variables for analysis.


######## RegressionAnal.py

This Script is for a project where the best model is selected based on MSE. The code will use one csv file for training,
and testing model to create model then execute model for predicted values for predicted file. The analysis is done through the process of 
exploratory analysis, transformation, and regression analysis using Cross Validation and Gradient Descent. Functions utlized
in this script were imported in from RegFun.py. A Dictonary was created to store predicted values from both process and the best
option was selected. The select values were inserted into predicted file and exported as a csv. 


###### OKGWRcode3.py

This script is an example of ETL, Geopatial Machine Learning, and manipulation of Remote Sensing data analyze the accuracy of
historical weather data to determine its accuracy. AccuWeather historical data was compared to Weather Deciscion Technologies data for accuracy by
using Oklahoma Mesonet data as a barometer. The final process will generate the mean absolute error for AccuaWeather and WDT compared to the accurate Oklahoma mesonet stations
via aggregation on a daily, monthly, and seasonal time period for analysis.
