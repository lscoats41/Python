### PulseExtractProcessAuto.py
This script will unzip numerous files from various naval ships and search through to find specific files to extract data pertaining to IT hardware or software then transform it 
to qualitative variables to send alerts when needed. The transformed data will exported to text files for ingestion into a SQL Data Repository called Aras. This script was created then automated
on a weekly basis. 

### PulseFunction.py
This script is a group of functions that will be used in main script PulseExtractProcessAuto.py to execute the ETL process

### RandomForestCode.py
This script was used to predict weather variables at several weather stations in the future upcoming hours. RandomForestRegressor was used in a pipeline
along with standardscaler as a preprocessing method before RandomForestRegressor was used to generate model. 


#### VotingTrainModelArg.py
This script is where a voting classifier from sklearn is used to develop the best model to predict coronary heart disease.
KNN, Logistic Regression, Gaussian, and RandomForestClassifier was used in model.

### RibeyePrediction.py
This script is where future prices are predicted by requested quantities. The model was created in RibeyeBidDataStackRV.py


### RibeyeBidDataStackRV.py
This script is used to develope and save a GLM model to predict past prices of products purchased base on quantity by contract. Once the best model model
for material in each contract was saved, The model was utilized in the scripts RibeyePrediction.py. Script will also generate graphs for visualization to veiw
predicted versus actual results. 


##### InflationAdj.py
This script is with a created Class call inflate to adjust prices of material to present time before Regression Analysis is utilized in 
RibeyeBidDataStackRV.py



###### RegFun.Py

This Script is a script with several functions that can be accessed when a user
is going through multivariate regression analysis to determine a targt variable, trainning the model,
and testing the model. The libraries imported in were sklearn, numpy, and matplotlib to generate
histograms, scatterplots, and linear regression values to evaluate training models and testing models.
Cross Validation and Gradient Descent were method for analysis of multivariat regression analysis.
This script will handle more than one variable as independent variables for analysis.


######## RegressionAnal.py

This Script is for a project where the best model is selected based on MSE. The code will use one csv file for training,
and testing model to create model then execute model for predicted values for predicted file. The analysis is done through the process of 
exploratory analysis, transformation, and regression analysis using Cross Validation and Gradient Descent. Functions utlized
in this script were imported in from RegFun.py. A Dictonary was created to store predicted values from both process and the best
option was selected. The select values were inserted into predicted file and exported as a csv. 


###### OKGWRcode3.py

This script is an example of ETL, Geopatial Machine Learning, and manipulation of Remote Sensing data analyze the accuracy of
historical weather data to determine its accuracy. AccuWeather historical data was compared to Weather Deciscion Technologies data for accuracy by
using Oklahoma Mesonet data as a barometer. The final process will generate the mean absolute error for AccuaWeather and WDT compared to the accurate Oklahoma mesonet stations
via aggregation on a daily, monthly, and seasonal time period for analysis.
